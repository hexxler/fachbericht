Game Development has come a long way since its first creations in the 1950s and 1960s. 
Over the years, many products were launched that offer a simple promise. They take care of the hard parts, which include but aren't limited to, rendering graphics, loading assets and thread management. With this paper we want to analyze what the market offers in 2021. \\
\par Looking at it from the perspective of someone that has no knowledge or experience in the field of game development, we hope to bring forth a simple comparison of the current products and who or what they are best suited for.
