	abstract = {In 3D computer graphics and solid modeling, a polygon mesh is a collection of vertices, edges and faces that defines the shape of a polyhedral object. The faces usually consist of triangles (triangle mesh), quadrilaterals (quads), or other simple convex polygons (n-gons), since this simplifies rendering, but may also be more generally composed of concave polygons, or even polygons with holes.
The study of polygon meshes is a large sub-field of computer graphics (specifically 3D computer graphics) and geometric modeling. Different representations of polygon meshes are used for different applications and goals. The variety of operations performed on meshes may include: Boolean logic, smoothing, simplification, and many others. Algorithms also exist for ray tracing, collision detection, and rigid-body dynamics with polygon meshes. If the mesh's edges are rendered instead of the faces, then the model becomes a wireframe model.
Volumetric meshes are distinct from polygon meshes in that they explicitly represent both the surface and volume of a structure, while polygon meshes only explicitly represent the surface (the volume is implicit).
Several methods exist for mesh generation, including the marching cubes algorithm.},

	abstract = {In 1996, Nintendo blew gamers minds and released the latest iteration of the Super Mario franchise, featuring a fully 3D world that would set the tone for every 3D platform to come. We were also introduced to a version of Mario we'd never seen before, made of polygons, rather than pixels.

Mario has changed a lot since Super Mario 64, but, just how much? I think it's time we get reacquainted. This is Low Poly!
